jenkins:
  image: jenkins/jenkins:2.357
  ports:
    - "127.0.0.1:8880:8080"
  volumes:
    - ./jenkins_home_host:/var/jenkins_home
  # using a bind mount to the host `./jenkins_home` means I can easily peruse the jenkins_home files without needing to "get into the container"
  restart: unless-stopped
  # a named volume is fine too - jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home
